# Project Status & Development Log

**Last Updated:** November 28, 2025
**Project:** Circle DXB - Telegram Agent & Dashboard

## 1. Project Overview

We are building a powerful, modular **Telegram Automation Agent** with a sleek **Web Dashboard**. The goal is to manage Telegram groups, contacts, and messages programmatically, and eventually integrate AI agents to interact with these chats.

## 2. Architecture Stack

* **Backend**: Python 3.12+
  * **Framework**: FastAPI (exposes REST endpoints).
  * **Telegram SDK**: Telethon (handles MTProto connection).
  * **Server**: Uvicorn.
* **Frontend**: Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS (Single Page Application).
  * **Styling**: Custom "GitHub Dark Mode" CSS.
  * **Auth**: Firebase Auth (Email/Password + Google Sign-In).
  * **Database**: Firebase Firestore (User data sync).
* **Infrastructure**:
  * **Process Manager**: PM2.
  * **Reverse Proxy**: Caddy (handles SSL/Domains).
  * **Deployment**: Git-based (GitHub -> Server) + SCP for secrets.

## 3. Completed Milestones

### ✅ Phase 1: Core Telegram Agent (`/`)

* Established connection to Telegram using `Telethon`.
* Created modular utilities in `utils.py`:
  * `create_group`, `edit_group_title`, `delete_group`.
  * `add_contact`, `remove_contact`.
  * `scrape_messages` (saves to JSON for AI training).
* Implemented logging (`logger.py`) and configuration (`config.py` with `.env`).

### ✅ Phase 2: API Server (`server.py`)

* Wrapped all utilities in a **FastAPI** application.
* Endpoints created:
  * `POST /groups`, `PUT /groups/{id}`, `DELETE /groups/{id}`
  * `POST /contacts`, `DELETE /contacts/{id}`
  * `POST /messages/scrape`
* Server runs on port **8001** (configurable).

### ✅ Phase 3: Web Dashboard (`/dashboard`)

* Built a responsive, dark-themed SPA.
* **UI Components**: Sidebar, Quick Actions, Stats, Activity Log, Modals (Create Group, Add Contact).
* **Views**: Dashboard, Groups, Single Chats, Settings.
* **Authentication**:
  * Integrated **Firebase Auth**.
  * Implemented **Google Sign-In** and Email/Password.
  * **Firestore Sync**: Automatically creates/updates a `users` document upon login with fields: `uid`, `email`, `display_name`, `photo_url`, `phone_number`, `created_time`.
  * Security Rules: Users can only read/write their own documents.

### ✅ Phase 4: Deployment & Security

* Created `ecosystem.config.js` for PM2.
* Created `DEPLOY.md` with specific instructions for the `api.openfinance.cloud` server.
* Configured Caddyfile for `telegram.openfinance.cloud`.
* **Security Update**: Added `secrets/` to `.gitignore` to prevent credential leakage.
* **Production Deployment**: Successfully deployed to server, uploaded secrets via SCP, and verified live operation.

## 4. Current State

* **Backend**: Fully functional and running. Can perform all Telegram actions via API.
* **Frontend**: UI is polished. Auth is fully working and syncing with Firestore.
* **Integration**: The Frontend is currently **mocked** for data (except Auth). It does not yet call the Backend APIs to actually create groups or fetch chats.
* **Production**: The app is live at `https://telegram.openfinance.cloud/dashboard`.

## 5. Roadmap & Next Steps

### 🚀 Immediate Next Steps

1. **Frontend-Backend Integration**:
    * Connect "Create Group" modal to `POST /groups`.
    * Connect "Add Contact" modal to `POST /contacts`.
    * Fetch real Groups list from Telegram to populate the "Groups" view.
    * Fetch real Chats list for "Single Chats" view.
2. **Message Interface**:
    * Build the chat view to see and send messages from the dashboard.
3. **AI Integration**:
    * Create the "AI Agents" section.
    * Implement logic to feed scraped messages to an LLM.
    * Allow the agent to reply automatically.

### 🔮 Future Goals

* Advanced Analytics Dashboard.
* Multi-account support.
* Visual Flow Builder for Agent logic.

## 6. Development Log (Recent Actions)

* **2025-11-28**:
  * Initialized project structure (Telethon, FastAPI).
  * Built Dashboard UI (HTML/CSS/JS).
  * Integrated Firebase Auth & Firestore.
  * Deployed to `api.openfinance.cloud`.
  * Secured credentials by ignoring `secrets/` and updating deployment guide.
  * Verified Google Sign-In and Firestore user creation on production.
